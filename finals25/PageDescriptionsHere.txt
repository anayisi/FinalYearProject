LANDING PAGE
I want a landing page for an online examination management system, I want it in three divisions. The top division should be a navigation pane, there should be a log in button at the right side of this pane, at the left side, there should be a logo that can be replaced with my schoolâ€™s logo. And at the center of this pane, I want the name of the school written in bold.
The middle pane/division should hold a bold sign up button. And the lower pane/division should hold an about section, describing the function of the online examination management system.

LOGIN PAGE
The login page has the logo of the university on the right side of the webpage header , with the name of the university aligned in the middle with a sub-header of the system name and a signup button at the left corner of the header.
A form labeled "Login" with requirement as follows , email/username ,Id number, password, with a log in button at the bottom and a forgot password link below.
And a footer with names of three developers and below the names is the year and copyright text.
