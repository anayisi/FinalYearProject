    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
    This project presents the development of an Online Examination Management 
    System (OEMS) tailored for the University of Energy and Natural Resources (UENR).<br>
    The OEMS aims to automate the examination process, enhance academic efficiency,
    and address security vulnerabilities in traditional examination environments.<br>
    The system is designed to support administrators, lecturers, and students, 
    offering functionalities such as user management, question bank  management,<br>
    exam scheduling, and result processing.
    </p>
    <p>
    Leveraging modern web technologies, the backend is developed using PHP with the 
    Code Igniter framework and MongoDB for database management, while the frontend<br> 
    utilizes Bootstrap for responsive design. The system ensures robust security
    through SHA-256 encryption for user passwords. Through comprehensive testing<br>
    and evaluation, the OEMS demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency,
    security, and accessibility compared to traditional examination processes.<br>
    This report details the system's architecture, implementation, and potential
    impact on academic processes at UENR.<br>
